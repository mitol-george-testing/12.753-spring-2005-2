description: The famous Wawa Goose! Wawa is a picturesque lakefront town on the Trans-Canada
  Highway (17), 216 km (135 miles) north of Sault Ste. Marie. Wawa in the Ojibway
  language means "Wild Goose". Fittingly enough the town has erected this huge Canada
  Goose monument, the largest of it's kind in all of Canada, possibly the world...
