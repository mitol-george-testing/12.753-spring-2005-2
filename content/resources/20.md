description: 'Sudbury remains one of the world''s foremost nickel and copper mining
  camps with continuous production since 1886. Inco and Falconbridge Mining Companies
  have been mining nickel-copper ores in the Sudbury area of northern Ontario since
  1902 and 1929, respectively. Today, Incosrc="/NRs Sudbury operations consist of
  six underground mines, one mill, one smelter and one refinery, employing approximately
  6,400 people. Falconbridge operations consist of three underground mines, a mill
  and a smelter, employing approximately 1,500 people. These facilities are spread
  throughout the 60-kilometre-long, oval-shaped geological formation known as the
  Sudbury Basin. Nickel and copper are the primary metals produced, but cobalt and
  precious metals such as platinum and palladium are also recovered. The Geodynamics
  Group visited two Falconbridge mines: Craig Mine and Fraser Mine. Images courtesy
